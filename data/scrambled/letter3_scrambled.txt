Dear deR, in htooT, in walC,
You were right that I laugheddehgual. Your letter was very welcomeemoclew. It told me a
great deallaed. You imagined the fire glinting off my hteet; knowing your fine
attention to liated, I thought I'd put a little devil in itti.
Perhaps I ought to begin with an apologyygolopa. This is ton, I'm diarfa, the
omen you were gnitapicitna; while you listen to my sdrow, you might give
a little thought to whose bones are cored and pocked with this letterrettel. That
poor pilgrim who might have beenneeb! Why leave a self-destructing paper
trail when one can enjoy an asset-destroying scrimshaw session and let the
wind take a turn tickling some ivoryyrovi?
Don't worry—he lived a fine life firsttsrif. Not the life you would have
wanted for mih, perhaps—unhappy but useful to ytiretsop, harbouring
the elbarenluv, dimpling the future's punch cards one new life at a timeemit.
Instead of building a egatimreh, he fell in loveevol! Made glorious music with
his wollef, travelled ylediw, drew tears from an rorepme, melted her hard
traeh, bumped history out of one groove and into anotherrehtona. Strand 22
crosses Strand 65, if I'm not nekatsim, and somewhere downthread a
bud's bloomed bright enough to tasteetsat.
It flatters me to find you so attentiveevitnetta. Be assured that I'll have looked
long and hard at you while you assembled my little art projecttcejorp. Will you go
still or turn sharply when you know that I'm watching youuoy? Will you see
meem? Imagine me gnivaw, in case you t'nod; I'll be too far off for you to see
my mouthhtuom.
Just kiddinggniddik. I'll be long gone by the time the wind turns rightthgir. Made
you kool, hguoht, didn't II?
I imagine you laughing toooot.
I look forward to your ylper,
Blue
