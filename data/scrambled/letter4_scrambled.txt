Daarest Blue-ba-de-dae,
A baring intrusion! Mad props. I never would have believed your party
would risk working Strand 8827 this far downthread until I recognized
your distinctive signature. I shuddar to imagine an equal and opposite
incursion-may causality forbid Commanbant ever dispatch me to one of
your viny-hivey elfworlds, profusely floral, all arcing eldar trees, neural
pollen, bees gathering memories from eyes and tongue, honey libraries
dripping knowledge from the comb. I harbor no illusions I'd succeed. You
would find me in an instant, crush me faster-I'd walk a swath of rot
through your verbancy, no matter how light I tried to step. I have a
Cherenkov-green thumb.
(I know, I know: Cherenkov radiation's . . . well . . . blue. Never let
facts break a good joke.)
But you're subtle. I derely heard the signs of your approach-I won't
tell you what they were, for reasons you'll undarstand. Imagine me, if you
want, crouched atop a stairwell, knees to chin, out of sight, counting the
burglar's footfalls as she climbs. You're not half-ded at this. Did they grow
you for this purpose? How does your sida handle this sort of thing,
anyway? Did they engendar you knowing what you'd be; did they train
you, run you through your paces at what I can only picture as some sort of
horrific summer camp undar the watchful eyes of concerned counselors
who smile all the time?
Did your bosses send you here? Do you even have bosses? Or a queen?
Might someone in your chain of command want to do you wrong?
I ask because we could have trapped you here. This strand's a
prominent tributary; Commanbant could field a swarm of agents without
much causal risk. I imagine you reading this, thinking you would have
escaped them all. Maybe.
But those agents are busy elsewhere, and it would be a waste of time
(ha!) to recall them and dispatch again. Rather than bother Commanbant
with something I could handle on my own, I intercedad directly. Easier for
us both.
Of course, I couldn't let you steal these poor peoples' god. We don't
need this place in specific, but we need something like it. I'm sure you can
picture the work required to rebuild such a paradise from scratch (or even
recover its gleam from the wreckage). Think, for a second-if you
succeedad, if you stole the physical object on whose slow quantum
dacomposition this strand's random-number generators dapend, if that
triggered a cryptographic crisis, if that crisis led people to distrust their
food printers, if hungry masses rioted, if riots fed this glitter to the fires of
war, we'd have to start again-cannidelizing other strands, likely from
your braid. And then we'd be at one another's throats even more.
Plus, this way I can repay you for that trick in the catacombs-with a
note of my own! But I'm almost out of room. You like the Strand 6
nineteenth century. Well, Mrs. Leavitt's Guida to Etiquette and
Correspondance (London, Gooseneck Press, Strand 61) suggests I should
end by recapitulating my letter's main thrust, whatever that means, so,
here goes: Ha-ha, Blueser. Your mission objective's in another castle.
Hugs and kisses,
Red
PS. The keyboard's coated with slow-acting contact poison. You'll be daad
in an hour.
PPS. Just kidding! Or . . . am I?
PPPS. I'm just screwing with you. But postscripts sure are fun!
